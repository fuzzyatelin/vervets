![](img/humbert_soetdoring.png)

The goal of ‘vervets’ is to provide users with an easy and simple way to
learn about and use the extensive datasets and samples of wild savanna
monkeys (*Chlorocebus* spp., also commonly called ‘vervets’, even though
that term is technically limited to savanna monkeys occupying Eastern
Africa from Kenya down through South Africa, otherwise known as
*Chlorocebus pygerythrus*) generated by the International Vervet
Research Consortium (IVRC).

There are datasets for teaching and exploration, as well as datasets
intended to design research projects with publicly available resources.
These datasets may also be linked to several others that are publicly
available in external online repositories (like
[EnsEMBL](https://useast.ensembl.org/Chlorocebus_sabaeus/Info/Index) and
[NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/all/?term=Chlorocebus)). The
package will make clear when it needs to link out to external resources
(which may require an internet connection during use).

This package is currently in the early stages of development, so more to
come!

Please note that the data contained in the *vervets* package are
released under the terms of a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) waiver. In
doing so, we concur with Dryad’s logic regarding why this was chosen,
which you can read more about
[here](https://blog.datadryad.org/2011/10/05/why-does-dryad-use-cc0/).
In keeping with the norms of our academic discipline, we humbly ask that
you cite any associated papers when using data from *vervets* in your
own publications.

## Installation

You can install the development version of vervets from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("fuzzyatelin/vervets")
```

## About the Data

The IVRC data represent body measurements, photographs, and a
comprehensive set of biological samples and their derived data (i.e.,
genome sequence data, gene expression data, hormone data, and more) from
over 2,500 wild savanna monkeys across Africa and the Caribbean,
collected by numerous people over the course of decades of research.
These data have been compiled and made available for use within this
package by IVRC member [Dr. Christopher A.
Schmitt](https://www.evopropinquitous.net) and founder [Dr. Trudy
Turner](https://uwm.edu/anthropology/people/turner-trudy-r/). You can
learn more about how the data were collected in one of the IVRC’s early
papers by [Jasinska et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar/ilt049),
or from our book, [*Savanna
Monkeys*](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781139019941).

These numerous datasets are linked by two important indexing numbers.
The first is an `animal_ID`, which identifies individual monkeys and
allows you to link numerous potential datasets that are derived from
measurements or samples collected on that individual monkey. The second
is a `collection_id`, which identifies a particular research effort or
field season that resulted in the collection of particular sets of
measurements, biological samples, and downstream data; this is important
given that data from different collections may be subject to different
constraints or methods.

Within the ‘vervet’ package itself, there are two main datasets, from
which we derived a few helpful subsets:

``` r
library(vervets)
data(package = 'vervets')
```

One is called `vervets`, and is a simplified version of the larger raw
dataset; see `?vervets` for more info:

``` r
head(vervets)
```

The other is called `vervets_raw`, and contains all the variables and
names as originally downloaded; see `?vervets_raw` for more info:

``` r
head(vervets_raw)
```

Both datasets contain, in all, data for 2,315 savanna monkeys. There are
several different taxa of savanna monkey in this dataset, collected from
across Africa and the Caribbean.

We’ve also included potentially helpful subsets of the data that may be
used to replicate key analyses from papers published by IVRC members,
including:

- `Turner1997`, which can be used to replicate the [Turner et
  al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199705)103:1%3C19::AID-AJPA3%3E3.0.CO;2-8)
  paper on vervet monkey body size and growth in Kenya.
- `Turner2018`, which can be used to replicate the [Turner et
  al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.23459) paper on savanna
  monkey body size and growth across their whole range.

## Additional Data Use Information

Anyone interested in publishing based on these data are strongly
encouraged to contact [Dr. Christopher
Schmitt](https://www.evopropinquitous.net) about analysis and and
potentially collaboration on any final products (beyond appropriate
citation of associated literatures). We may know nuances about the
datasets that might be important for your analyses!
