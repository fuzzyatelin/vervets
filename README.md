# The *vervets* Package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

![](img/humbert_soetdoring.png)

The goal of *vervets* is to provide users with an easy and simple way to
learn about and use the extensive datasets and samples of wild savanna
monkeys (*Chlorocebus* spp., also commonly called ‘vervets’ even though,
technically speaking, that term is limited to savanna monkeys occupying
Eastern Africa from Kenya down through South Africa, otherwise known as
*Chlorocebus pygerythrus*) generated by the International Vervet
Research Consortium (IVRC).

This package is currently in the early stages of development, so more to
come!

Please note that the data contained in the *vervets* package are
released under the terms of a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) waiver. In
doing so, we concur with Dryad’s logic regarding why this was chosen,
which you can read more about
[here](https://blog.datadryad.org/2011/10/05/why-does-dryad-use-cc0/).
In keeping with the norms of our academic discipline, we humbly ask that
you cite any associated papers when using data from *vervets* in your
own publications.
