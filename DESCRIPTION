Description: The goal of *vervets* is to provide users with an easy and simple way to learn about and use the extensive datasets and samples of wild savanna monkeys (*Chlorocebus* spp., also commonly called 'vervets') generated by the International Vervet Research Consortium (IVRC). This package is currently in the early stages of development, so more to come!
